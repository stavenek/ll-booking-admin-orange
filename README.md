## How to Start the Webserver

You can easily run this app locally by serving the `index.html` file with a simple web server using Node.js and the `serve` package:

### Using Node.js (`serve` package)

1. Install the `serve` package globally (if not already installed):
   ```sh
   npm install -g serve
   ```
2. Start the server:
   ```sh
   serve .
   ```
3. Open your browser and go to the URL shown in the terminal (usually [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)).

You can now use the admin interface in your browser.
